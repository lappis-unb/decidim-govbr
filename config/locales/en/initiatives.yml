It enables descendant scope and works with an authorization handler that associates a scope with the user. Make sure to select this authorization below in the authorization settings. For this to work, scopes need to be configured hierarchically: 1 Parent - N Descendants. For more information on how this configuration works, see the following <a href="https://docs.decidim.org/en/admin/spaces/initiatives/" target="_blank">link</a>.'
            only_global_scope_enabled_help: Check this option if you have enabled "descendant scope of signatures" and configured the global scope as your parent scope. Enabling this will skip the initiative type selection in the initiative creation wizard.
